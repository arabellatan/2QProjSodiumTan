            Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer FPS (first-person shooter) developed by Valve. Its gameplay centers around two opposing teams fighting to complete an objective. There are  <a href= "htdocs/page1.html">9 playable classes</a> to choose from, each with their own distinct roles in the game. In most <a href= "htdocs/page2.html">game modes</a>, players choose to join either RED or BLU team and complete combat-based objectives. The game originally had Capture the Flag, Control Point, and Territorial Control as its only game modes, but now it has been updated with more official and community-created game modes. There are also official <a href= "htdocs/page3.html">comics</a> featuring the 9 classes and non-playable classes such as The Administrator, Miss Pauling, and Saxton Hale. Some comics explain the origins of certain weapons in the game, while the others give backgrounds on the characters and their personalities.
